- [x] use the built in coredns in k3s then expose the custom coredns on a vip. i
      dunno how i want this to work with the k8s_gateway plugin, i had an idea that
      came to me in a dream but it has escaped me :(
- [x] add k8s.mattprovost.dev as an internally resolved hostname
- [ ] create a virtual network interface on every node to use for multus
- [ ] make the multus interface well known
